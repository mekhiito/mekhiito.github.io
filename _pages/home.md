### <span style="color:#0D98BA">**Abdelmajid**</span> Essofi

I am a research assistant at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) under the supervision of [Dr. Qirong Ho](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/qirong-ho/) and [Dr. Willie Neiswanger](https://willieneis.github.io/). In our research, we are aiming to build an ecosystem to manage a fully automated optimization of AI pipelines, while minimizing the carbon footprint in the process.

### <span style="color:#0D98BA">**Education**</span>
in 2021-2022, I attended MBZUAI, where I defended my thesis to obtain my MSc in [Machine Learning](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/your-future-starts-here/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=student-recruitment&utm_term=machine-learning&utm_content=masters&&utm_marin=pcrid_652099024480_pgrid_150858788281_pkw_machine%20learning%20masters_pmt_b_productid__ptaid_aud-2181372747052:kwd-401329945917_adext_) from MBZUAI under the supervision of [Dr. Le Song](https://dasongle.github.io/index.html).  
In 2015-2019, I attended Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane (AUI), where I obtained my BSc in [Computer Science](http://www.aui.ma/en/sse/undergraduates/abet/bscsc.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Violetta Cavalli-Sforza](http://www.aui.ma/en/sse/faculty.html?itemid=117).  
In Fall 2017, I attended [Beloit College](https://www.beloit.edu/) as an exchange student.

### <span style="color:#0D98BA">**Programming Contests**</span>
In 2016, 2018, and 2019, I represented my university, along with two teammates, in the annual Moroccan Collegiate Programming contest (MCPC), where my team successfully obtained the first place in both [MCPC 2018](https://www.facebook.com/MoroccanCPC/photos/ms.c.eJw1yMEJADAIA8CNiommxv0XKxS85wFitAq4FOWDDXMwrI3Uj4wNVY2s9gPI4Q2I.bps.a.1152075308291935/1152075544958578/?type=3&size=960%2C640&fbid=1152075544958578&paipv=0&eav=AfYecPiL25DU3x8BZKP3cIc9qA8Uqyv1yQz8W3V4E6mO7yjuXM-9t_tYSavUi2KCmOU&_rdr), and [MCPC 2019](http://www.aui.ma/en/media-room/news/al-akhawayn-news/3630-mcpc-article-aui-wins-programming-contest-for-sixth-consecutive-year.html). From the Moroccan regionals, we qualified to represent our country in the Arab Collegiate Programming Contest, where we ranked first among the teams of the Maghreb region in the 2018 edition to obtain the Maghreb Champions prize.

### <span style="color:#0D98BA">**Internships**</span>
**[Peixoto Atacadista - Brazil](https://www.peixoto.com.br/)**  
    In March 2018, I joined Peixoto Atacadista, a logistics company in Uberl√¢ndia, for my first internship as a full-stack software development intern, where I developed a website for their human resources department to manage applications and filter candidate using given filters.

**[Leyton - Morocco](https://leyton.com/ma/)**  
    In June 2019, I took my first steps into the field of AI by joining Leyton as a machine learning engineering intern, where I was in charge of building a prediction model that uses the data collected on advertisement panels to predict the prices of posting advertisements in each panel.

**[Alicante Healthcare - France](http://www.alicante.healthcare/)**  
    After obtaining my bachelor's degree in December 2019, I spent the first six month of the Covid era in Lille as a Big Data Analytics intern with Alicante, where I learned to use Spark and Hadoop to receive data from a streaming pipeline, run statistics on notes received by healthcare centers, before pushing the retrieved statistics to a cloud-based database.

**[Jump Trading - Singapore](https://www.jumptrading.com/)**  
    In June 2022, I was introduced to the incredible uses of optimal machine learning techniques for high frequency trading during my internship as a quantitative researcher in Jump Trading, where I built a linear model that uses pre-defined alpha signals to predict the future price change of a given symbol, as well as a reinforcement learning agent that performs trades based on the current market state, with the aim of maximizing the end-of-day profits.
